About:
Facebook Chat is a python script that interface Facebook chat to cleverbot severs. It automatically replies to your buddies' messages without any kind of input from you. If you want to know what kind of reply it gives, try cleverbot.com. This script uses Sleekxmpp library, an excellent work from Fritzy for managing the xmpp protocol. 

Requirements:
* Python 2.x (Tested on 2.7.x). Gives encoding error in Python 3. Hopes to fix it soon.
* Sleekxmpp

Installation:
* Install Python 2.7.x. Use Virtual Environment if possible. 
* Using PIP install Sleekxmpp.
* Copy Cleverbot.py and Chatbotfinal.py to the same folder. Discard remaining files.
* Edit Chatbotfinal.py. Set correct values for "JID" and "Password".
* Run Chatbotfinal.py.

Optionally you can clone the whole project and push to Heroku to run it on the cloud 24x7. It's completely free.


Suggestion/Contribution:
Install it, Test it and if you got better ideas, try to improve it. It's completely open.
